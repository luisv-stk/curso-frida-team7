# Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

This project involves enhancing a drag-and-drop image upload interface by expanding the dragging zone area. The current implementation appears to have a limited drop area that cuts off or restricts the drag-and-drop functionality, negatively impacting user experience. The solution requires modifying the CSS styling to create a larger, more accessible drop zone while maintaining the existing visual design and functionality.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality

**REQ-F001** (Must Have): The drag-and-drop area must be expanded to provide adequate space for users to drag files without the interface being cut off or truncated.

**REQ-F002** (Must Have): The expanded drop area must maintain all existing drag-and-drop behaviors including:
- Visual feedback when hovering over the drop zone
- Drag-over state indication with color changes and animations
- Proper file acceptance and rejection handling

**REQ-F003** (Must Have): The drop area must support multiple file selection and upload simultaneously.

**REQ-F004** (Must Have): Image preview functionality must remain intact after drop area modifications.

### 2.2 User Interactions

**REQ-F005** (Must Have): Users must be able to drag files from anywhere within the expanded drop zone without losing the drag state.

**REQ-F006** (Must Have): The drop area must provide clear visual boundaries that are easily identifiable.

**REQ-F007** (Should Have): Users should receive immediate visual feedback when entering and exiting the drop zone.

**REQ-F008** (Must Have): The interface must support both drag-and-drop and traditional file selection methods.

### 2.3 Data Management

**REQ-F009** (Must Have): All uploaded images must maintain their metadata and categorization capabilities.

**REQ-F010** (Must Have): Image deletion functionality must continue to work after modifications.

**REQ-F011** (Must Have): Bulk operations on images must remain functional.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

**REQ-NF001**: The expanded drop area must not negatively impact page load times (target: < 3 seconds).

**REQ-NF002**: Drag-and-drop animations must maintain smooth 60fps performance.

**REQ-NF003**: The interface must handle up to 50 simultaneous file uploads without performance degradation.

### 3.2 Security

**REQ-NF004**: File type validation must be maintained for all upload methods.

**REQ-NF005**: Maximum file size restrictions must continue to be enforced.

**REQ-NF006**: The expanded drop area must not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.

### 3.3 Usability

**REQ-NF007**: The drop area must be at least 300px in height on desktop devices.

**REQ-NF008**: The drop area must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

**REQ-NF009**: Visual indicators must be colorblind-friendly and accessible.

**REQ-NF010**: The interface must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

### 3.4 Reliability

**REQ-NF011**: The drag-and-drop functionality must work consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.

**REQ-NF012**: Error handling must gracefully manage failed uploads and provide user feedback.

**REQ-NF013**: The interface must recover gracefully from network interruptions during upload.

## 4. User Stories

**US001**: As a content manager, I want to drag files anywhere within a large drop zone so that I don't accidentally miss the target area when uploading multiple images.

**US002**: As a user with motor difficulties, I want a generous drop area so that I can easily drag files without precise positioning.

**US003**: As a mobile user, I want the drop area to be appropriately sized for touch interactions so that I can easily upload files on my device.

**US004**: As a power user, I want to see clear visual feedback when dragging files so that I know exactly when I'm in the correct drop zone.

**US005**: As a designer, I want the expanded drop area to maintain the existing purple theme and animations so that the interface remains visually cohesive.

**US006**: As a user, I want to be able to drag multiple files at once into the expanded area so that I can efficiently upload batches of images.

**US007**: As an administrator, I want the drag area to work consistently across all supported browsers so that all users have the same experience.

## 5. Constraints and Assumptions

### 5.1 Technical Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing Angular/CSS framework
- Cannot modify the underlying drag-and-drop JavaScript functionality
- Must preserve existing Bootstrap grid system integration
- CSS modifications only - no HTML structure changes allowed

### 5.2 Business Constraints

- Solution must be implemented within current sprint cycle
- No additional third-party libraries can be introduced
- Must maintain existing brand color scheme (#ff11f2 purple theme)
- Cannot break existing functionality during implementation

### 5.3 Assumptions

- Current browser support requirements remain unchanged
- Existing file upload backend can handle the modified interface
- Users are familiar with drag-and-drop interactions
- The current responsive breakpoints (768px) are appropriate
- Existing accessibility features are sufficient and should be preserved

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria

| Requirement | Success Criteria | Verification Method |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Expanded Drop Area | Drop area height increased to minimum 400px on desktop | Visual inspection and CSS measurement |
| Visual Continuity | All existing animations and color schemes preserved | Cross-browser testing |
| Responsive Design | Drop area scales appropriately on mobile (min 250px height) | Device testing across breakpoints |
| Drag Functionality | Files can be dropped anywhere within expanded area | Manual testing with various file types |
| Performance | No increase in render time or animation lag | Performance profiling tools |

### Technical Acceptance Criteria

- CSS validates without errors
- No console errors introduced by changes
- Existing unit tests continue to pass
- Cross-browser compatibility maintained
- Accessibility standards not compromised

## 7. Implementation Specifications

### 7.1 CSS Modifications Required

**Primary Changes**:
- Increase `.drop-area` minimum height from current value to 400px
- Adjust responsive breakpoint styles for mobile devices
- Ensure proper padding and margin calculations

**Responsive Adjustments**:
```css
.drop-area {
  min-height: 400px; /* Increased from current */
  padding: 2rem; /* Ensure adequate internal spacing */
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .drop-area {
    min-height: 300px !important; /* Increased from 250px */
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```

### 7.2 Testing Requirements

- Test drag-and-drop functionality across expanded area
- Verify visual feedback animations work correctly
- Confirm responsive behavior on various screen sizes
- Validate accessibility with screen readers
- Performance test with multiple simultaneous uploads

- Implementation of new upload progress indicators
- Modifications to the existing color scheme or branding
- Changes to the card layout or image thumbnail sizes
